# ----------
# Part Two
#
# Now we'll make the scenario a bit more realistic. Now Traxbot's
# sensor measurements are a bit noisy (though its motions are still
# completetly noise-free and it still moves in an almost-circle).
# You'll have to write a function that takes as input the next
# noisy (x, y) sensor measurement and outputs the best guess 
# for the robot's next position.
#
# ----------
# YOUR JOB
#
# Complete the function estimate_next_pos. You will be considered 
# correct if your estimate is within 0.01 stepsizes of Traxbot's next
# true position. 
#
# ----------
# GRADING
# 
# We will make repeated calls to your estimate_next_pos function. After
# each call, we will compare your estimated position to the robot's true
# position. As soon as you are within 0.01 stepsizes of the true position,
# you will be marked correct and we will tell you how many steps it took
# before your function successfully located the target bot.

# These import steps give you access to libraries which you may (or may
# not) want to use.

# This is the function you have to write. Note that measurement is a 
# single (x, y) point. This function will have to be called multiple
# times before you have enough information to accurately predict the
# next position. The OTHER variable that your function returns will be 
# passed back to your function the next time it is called. You can use
# this to keep track of important information over time.
