## segmentation
Implement the segmentation network architectures [U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) and [TernausNetV2](https://github.com/ternaus/TernausNetV2) for image segmentation. The network architecture use the code in [TernausNetV2](https://github.com/ternaus/TernausNetV2).
